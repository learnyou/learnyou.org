# Learn You Some Algebras for Glorious Good!

This is a math book. We aim to take a logically rigorous, yet informal
approach to math.

The title (and content) is inspired by Miran Lipovaƒça's
[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!][lyah]. LYAH is unfortunately a bit
out of date, so I don't recommend it for Haskell. I instead recommend
[bitemyapp's guide][bmag].

I have observed that most math (and science) books nowadays seem to take
an approach wherein it's more important to keep an academic tone than it
is for the reader to understand the material, and, more importantly,
enjoy reading the book. We take the opposite approach. We want to create
a book that is fun to read, easy to understand, while still addressing
the more advanced concepts in math.

If you have any questions about LYSA (or math), feel free to ask in the
channel, or in the issue tracker.
