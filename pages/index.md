# Learn You!

This is a project to create free and open-source learning materials, be
them textbooks, interactive online things, or whatever.

We only have two projects at the moment:

1. [*Learn You Some Algebras for Glorious Good!*](/lysa.html), a math
   textbook.
2. This website.

*What does "free and open-source" mean?*

Contrary to popular belief, it actually has nothing to do with the fact
that you don't have to pay for our work.  It means you are free to do
certain things with our work. Specifically, you have these four
freedoms:[^1]

1. The freedom to use our work as you wish, for any purpose.
2. The freedom to change our work if you don't like it.
3. The freedom to distribute exact copies of our work.
3. The freedom to distribute modified copies of our work.

You can even sell our work if you want to. Nothing's stopping you.

I'm tired of saying "our work". Instead, I'm going to say "book", but
understand that "book" could in theory refer to something else.[^2]

"Free" is a somewhat ambiguous term, because in this context, it usually
refers to price. Most people prefer the term "open-source", which more
or less [means the same thing][2].

Curiously enough, it is actually to our benefit to make our books
open-source.

*Wait, so you're giving your books away, and that benefits you somehow?*

Yep. Basically, if someone sees a way to improve a book, they are
welcome to. In most cases, that person will actually send us back their
changes, and thus the quality of the book improves, with no effort from
us. This happens more than you would think.

[^1]:   These freedoms are adapted from
        https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html

[^2]:   Although, at this point, all we have is an unfinished book. So,
        actually, "book" only refers to a book.
