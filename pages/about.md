# Learn You!

To be perfectly honest, I got this domain because I couldn't find `lysa`
.anything, and `learnyou.org` was pretty memorable. But, it occured to
me that it would be nice if there were a project to create easy-to-read,
fun, free, and open-source learning materials.

With that in mind, this is a project to create easy-to-read, fun, free,
and open-source learning materials.

At the moment, there's one guy, me, Peter Harpending. I only have the
one project: [*Learn You Some Algebras for Glorious Good!*][1], a math
textbook. I have other projects, just none other that are relevant here.

If you have an idea/criticism/audible rant, feel free to share it with
me. Here's my contact information:

* The LYSA IRC channel is [`#lysa` on FreeNode][6].
* You can view [the LYSA GitHub page][7].
* You can email `peter@harpending.org` with your issue.

I'd be very open to people adding more projects under the LearnYou
umbrella. I'm willing to give you a lot of autonomy. 

It doesn't have to be books. Interactive things, videos, etc, would all
be fine, as long as they are reasonably approachable, and open-source..

### What do "free" and "open-source" mean?

It has nothing to do with the fact that you don't have to pay for my
book. Although, that is a bonus.

It means that my book satisfies the respecitive definitions of

1. [free cultural works][4], and
2. [open works][5].

The "tl;dr" of it is: you can share, modify, and improve my book. The
book is licensed under the [Creative Commons ShareAlike license][8].

This setup is beneficial to everyone

* **You**, the reader, benefit from not having to pay for the book, and
  being able to share it with others without dealing with copyright
  nonsense.

* **I**, the writer, benefit from people improving the book.

### Wait, so you're giving your books away, and that benefits you somehow?

Yep. Basically, if someone sees a way to improve the book, they are
welcome to. In most cases, that person will actually send me back their
changes. Thus the quality of the book improves, with minimal effort on
my part. This happens more than you would think.
