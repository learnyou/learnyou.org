-- |This file builds and/or serves the site. To see the available
-- options run the command "runhaskell main.hs help".
-- 
-- You need to install Hakyll before running this. "cabal install
-- hakyll" will do the trick. If that doesn't work, please see
-- https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell for installation
-- instructions, then run the command again. If that still doesn't
-- work, please open an issue on
-- https://github.com/pharpend/lyse/issues .
-- 
-- You'll also need SASS to compile the stylesheets. You can get SASS
-- by running "gem install sass". If that doesn't work, please install
-- Ruby, then run the command again. If that still doesn't work,
-- please open an issue on https://github.com/pharpend/lyse/issues .
-- 
-- Once you have installed all of the dependencies, you can either
-- compile the program with "ghc main.hs", and then run "./main". The
-- resulting binary will be marginally faster, but the compilation
-- will create a plethora of stupid files in the working
-- directory. For that reason, I recommend simply running the script
-- with "runhaskell main.hs serve".
