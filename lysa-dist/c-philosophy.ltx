\ch{Philosophy and/or FAQ}

by \pharpend

This book is written with a certain philosophy in mind. Explaining my
philosophy will answer a number of questions I am often asked.

First, I'll start with the license. he license I chose for this book is
the GNU Free Documentation License (FDL).  ``Free'' refers to freedom,
not price.  The FDL is similar in spirit to another license, the
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (CC-SA).

CC-SA is much more popular than the FDL, mostly because it is much more
general. You could distribute a painting under CC-SA, but not the
FDL. The CC-SA license and the FDL are both ``copyleft'' licenses, in
that they require that derivative works be licensed under the same
license.

\xti{So, why did you go with the FDL instead of CC-SA?}

The CC-SA license is too general to fit our purposes. The FDL is
specifically designed for reference texts, so it has a clause requiring
that the work be made available in source form. The CC-SA has no such
requirement.

Freedom is important, especially in academic works. Part of the reason I
wrote this book is that there are very few free textbooks.

To put it another way, it is of no benefit for the work to be nonfree.

\begin{itemize}
\item \item If the work is free, I, as a writer, benefit from people
giving me feedback, and improving upon my work.
\item You, as a reader, benefit from the freedom.
\end{itemize}

The only people who don't benefit are distributors (e.g. a
publisher). However, in the age of the internet, the need for a
for-profit publisher isn't exactly clear.

To be clear, it is perfectly okay for a publisher to publish this book,
and to attempt to profit off of it. However, the publisher wouldn't have
the traditional nonfree monopoly over the book, which might discourage a
publisher.
