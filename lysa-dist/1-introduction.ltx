Before I bore you with a bunch of stuff you don't care about, let's do
some math, shall we?

There are essentially three notions with which you need to be familiar
in order to do anything interesting in math. These three things are
\term{sets}, \term{functions}, and \term{proofs}.  Unfortunately, to be
familiar with one, you have to be familiar with the other
two.\footnote{You'll learn as we go along, when math people use a common
  term like {\it set}, {\it function}, {\it proof}, {\it group}, {\it
    continuous} or {\it closed}, they usually mean something similar in
  concept to the colloquial term, but there are some strings
  attached. This is usually the case in the sciences too
  (e.g. \xti{theory}, \xti{hypothesis}, \xti{experiment}).}

So, what are each of those things?


\begin{itemize}
  \item A \xti{set} is an unordered collection of things. There is also
    no repetition. For instance, $\mset{2, 5}$ is the same as
    $\mset{5, 2}$ (because order doesn't matter). $\mset{2, 5, 5}$ would
    be the same set, because there's no notion of multiplicity.

    You see what I did there? I subtly introduced some notation: the
    bracket notation for sets. This math stuff really isn't all that
    difficult. It's also really interesting if you approach it the right
    way.

  \item A \xti{function} is a mathematical construct (well, obviously,
    else I wouldn't be talking about it). Basically, it takes some
    input, does something to it, and spits out some output. If you give
    the function the same input a bunch of times, you should get the
    same result each time. This concept is called ``referential
    transparency.'' If the function is not referentially transparent,
    then it's not a function. It's something else.

  \item A \xti{proof} is basically where you take a bunch of simple
    facts, called \xti{axioms}, and chain them together to make
    \xti{theorem}s. It's sort of like sticking puzzle pieces together to
    form a picture.

    The puzzle pieces (in this case, the axioms) aren't usually very
    interesting on their own. However, the picture they form (in this
    case, the theorem) can be really cool and enlightening. The proof
    would be analogous to an explicit set of instructions explaining how
    to put the pieces together.
\end{itemize}

Once you are familiar with each of those concepts, we can do all sorts
of cool stuff. Throughout the book, we will prove all of the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If you tap your finger against a bridge at exactly the right
    frequency, the bridge will collapse. (Resonance)
  \item The formula used to calculate the interest rate on your mortgage
    is actually just a fancy form of the ratios of angles in a
    triangle. (Euler's formula)
\end{itemize}
