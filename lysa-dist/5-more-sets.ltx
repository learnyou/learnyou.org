\ch{More stuff about sets (and functions)}
\label{ch:more-sets}

By now, you hopefully have some idea into the basic intuition behind sets and
functions. Moreover, you've proven some cool stuff about them -- for instance,
you proved that a function is invertible iff it is bijective.

That's kind of cool, right? It's much easier to verify that a function is
bijective than it is to find its inverse. So, right off the bat, you can see if
a function is invertible without trying to invert it. Despite what you may
think, a common problem in math is to find inverse functions.

Speaking of functions, I'm going to define a really simple function:

\begin{alignedmath}
  \id : a \to a \\
  \evalat{\id}{x} = x
\end{alignedmath}

That function is about as simple as functions get. It's not a very interesting
function, but it's handy when defining things.

This is a slightly less simple function, but nonetheless important

\begin{alignedmath}
  \flip : \parens{a \to b \to c} \to b \to a \to c \\
  \eva{\flip}{f, x, y} = \eva{f}{y,x}
\end{alignedmath}

It takes a function, $f$, which takes an $a$ and a $b$, and then returns another
function with the arguments flipped. You won't usually see
$\eva{\flip}{\ld{x, y} x-y, 3, 5}$ floating around. Instead

\begin{alignmath}{rcl}
  f & : & p \to q \to r \\
  \eva{\flip}{f} & : & q \to p \to r \\
\end{alignmath}

Here's an infix operator:

\begin{alignedmath}
  \circ : \parens{b \to c} \to \parens{a \to b} \to a \to c \\
  \eva{\parens{f \circ g}}{x} = \eva{f}{\eva{g}{x}}
\end{alignedmath}

We're going to look at some more stuff with sets.

\s{Set subtraction}

First off, we have ``set subtraction''. This is sometimes called the ``relative
complement''.

\[ P \setminus Q = \mset{x \in P \semic x \notin Q} \]

$P \bs Q$ is all of the elements in $P$ that are not in $Q$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \inclgraph{setminus.png}
  \caption{Set subtraction}
  \label{fig:setminus}
\end{figure}

What would $P \bs P$ be, then? Well, $\nil$, of course, right! 

\[ P \setminus P = \mset{x \in P \semic x \notin P} = \nil \]

Well, that looks like a contradiction, doesn't it? Well, sort of. It's a
contradiction if you assume that $P$ is nonempty --- if you assume that there is
some element in $P$ --- if an element is both in $P$ and not in $P$, that would
be madness! But, if you realize that the comprehension is the ``set of objects
satisfying the condition'', then you don't encounter a contradiction.
$P \setminus P$ is the set of all objects in $P$ that are not in $P$: there are
no elements satisfying this condition, thus $P \bs P \equiv \nil$.

\Cref{fig:setminus} explains this idea graphically.

\ss{Complement}

If $P \subof \amb$, then $\amb \setminus P$ is called the ``\term{complement} of
$P$ with respect to $\amb$''. Yes, that's compl\xti{e}ment with an 'e', not
compl\xti{i}ment, with an 'i'. 

I drew another diagram to illustrate the complement in \cref{fig:complement}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \inclgraph{venn-complement-2.png}
  \caption{The complement, illustrated graphically. I tried to draw an $\amb$ in
    the upper right corner. It turned out terribly.}
  \label{fig:complement}
\end{figure}

In these exercises, you are going to prove every identity there is about sets.

\begin{ExcList}
  \Exercise{$A \bs \parens{B \cap C} \equiv \parens{A \bs B} \union \parens{A \bs C}$}
  \Exercise {$A \bs \parens{B \union C} \equiv \parens{A \bs B} \intersect \parens{A \bs C}$}
  \Exercise {$A \bs \parens{B \bs C} \equiv \parens{A \bs B} \union \parens{A \intersect C}$}
  \Exercise {$\parens{A \bs B} \intersect C \equiv \parens{A \cap C} \bs B \equiv A \intersect \parens{C \bs B}$}
  \Exercise {$\parens{A \bs B} \union C \equiv \parens{A \union C} \bs \parens{B \bs C}$}
  \Exercise {$A \bs A \equiv \nil$}
  \Exercise {$A \bs \nil \equiv A$}
  \Exercise {$\nil \bs A \equiv \nil$}
  \Exercise {$A \cap \parens{B \cup C} \equiv \parens{A \cap B} \cup \parens{A \cap C}$}
  \Exercise {$A \cup \parens{B \cap C} \equiv \parens{A \cup B} \cap \parens{A \cup C}$}
  \Exercise {$\parens{A^c}^c \equiv A$}
  \Exercise{\nm{\parens{A \cap B}^c \equiv A^c \cup B^c}} 
  \Exercise{\nm{\parens{A \union B}^c \equiv A^c \cap B^c}}
\end{ExcList}

\s{Cartesian products}

The next thing we need to go over is a \term{Cartesian product} - it's basically
a way to double up on a set. So, say we have a set $A$, and another set $B$, the
Cartesian product is the set of all 2-vectors, where the first element is from
$A$, and the second element is from $B$.

\begin{alignedmath}
  \times : \Setof{a} \to \Setof{b} \to \Classof{a,b} \\
  A \times B \ce \mset{\mvec{x,y} \st x \in A \land y \in B} \\
\end{alignedmath}

It's the class of all pairs of the elements in either set. It is actually a set,
too, but I haven't taught you enough to prove that. I also haven't taught you
what a class is. So, for the time being, know that the Cartesian product
produces a set, but at the same time you don't know that.

Let's see some examples!

\begin{alignmath}{rccl}
  \mset{1,2,3} \times \mset{4,5,6}
    & = & \{ & \mvec{1,4} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{1,5} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{1,6} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{2,4} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{2,5} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{2,6} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{3,4} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{3,5} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{3,6} \\
    &   & \} &            \\
\end{alignmath}

Alright, remember earlier when I told you to install Haskell? Well, if you
didn't, do it now: \cref{intro-idris}.

\begin{plainfile}
% ghci
GHCi, version 7.8.4: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Loading package ghc-prim ... linking ... done.
Loading package integer-gmp ... linking ... done.
Loading package base ... linking ... done.
Prelude> 
\end{plainfile}

GHCi is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, interactive. It's an interactive
interpreter for Haskell.

If you want to change your prompt to something other than \code{Prelude>}, then
write something like this:

\begin{plainfile}
Prelude> :set prompt "ghci: "
ghci: 
\end{plainfile}

If you want to do this permanently, add \code{:set prompt "ghci: "} to
\filepath{\tilde /.ghc/ghci.conf}.

I didn't just have you open up GHCi for no good reason. It's really easy to play
with these Cartesian products in GHCi. This way, you can experiment.

Remember the definition of the Cartesian product:

\begin{displaymath}
  A \times B \ce \mset{\mvec{x,y} \st x \in A \land y \in B}
\end{displaymath}

Let's try that example out. Math doesn't directly translate into Haskell. Some
of the syntax is a bit different.

\begin{haskell}
ghci: [(a,b) | a <- [1,2,3], b <- [4,5,6]]
[(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6)]
it :: (Num t1, Num t) => [(t, t1)]
\end{haskell}

% \newcommand{ghciconf}{\filepath{\tilde /.ghc/ghci.conf}}

That last line probably doesn't show up for you. It's just telling us the type
of our expression. To have it show up automatically for you, run \code{:set +t},
or add it to \filepath{\tilde /.ghc/ghci.conf}.

There are a number of ways to actually work out the mechanics of the
product. The simplest, and easiest way, is through \xti{recursion}. So, let's go
over the mechanics of $\mset{1,2,3} \times \mset{4,5,6}$. You take the first
element of the first set, in this case, $1$, and take the Cartesian product of
$\mset{1}$ and $\mset{4,5,6}$:

\[
\mset{1} \times \mset{4,5,6} =
\mset{
  \mvec{1,4},
  \mvec{1,5},
  \mvec{1,6}
}
\]

That's unreadable

\begin{alignmath}{rccc}
  \mset{1} \times \mset{4,5,6} & = & \{ & \mvec{1,4} \\
                               &   &  , & \mvec{1,5} \\
                               &   &  , & \mvec{1,6} \\
                               &   & \} &
\end{alignmath}

Pretty easy. Then you do the same thing with the second element.

\begin{alignmath}{rccc}
  \mset{2} \times \mset{4,5,6} & = & \{ & \mvec{2,4} \\
                               &   &  , & \mvec{2,5} \\
                               &   &  , & \mvec{2,6} \\
                               &   & \} &
\end{alignmath}

You guessed it!

\begin{alignmath}{rccc}
  \mset{3} \times \mset{4,5,6} & = & \{ & \mvec{3,4} \\
                               &   &  , & \mvec{3,5} \\
                               &   &  , & \mvec{3,6} \\
                               &   & \} &
\end{alignmath}

Then you take the union:
\newcommand{\unionformatted}[1]{\begin{array}{cc}
    \{ & \mvec{{#1},4} \\
     , & \mvec{{#1},5} \\                                                                                       
     , & \mvec{{#1},6} \\                                                                                       
    \} &               \\
  \end{array}}

\begin{alignmath}{rcccc}
  \mset{1,2,3} \times \mset{4,5,6} & = & \bigcup & \{ & \mset{1} \times \mset{4,5,6}, \\
                                   &   &         &  , & \mset{2} \times \mset{4,5,6}, \\
                                   &   &         &  , & \mset{3} \times \mset{4,5,6}, \\
                                   &   &         & \} & \\
\end{alignmath}

I'm going to have to display the intermediate result in a separate thing,
because it's just awful if I try to smush it in with the rest:

\begin{displaymath}
\unionformatted{1} \bigcup
\unionformatted{2} \bigcup
\unionformatted{3}
\end{displaymath}

Which evaluates to

\begin{alignmath}{rccl}
  \mset{1,2,3} \times \mset{4,5,6}
    & = & \{ & \mvec{1,4} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{1,5} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{1,6} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{2,4} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{2,5} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{2,6} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{3,4} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{3,5} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{3,6} \\
    &   & \} &            \\
\end{alignmath}

Okay, great. I hope you understand this so far. What happens when we take the
product of a set with itself?


\begin{alignmath}{rccl}
  \mset{1,2,3} \times \mset{1,2,3}
    & = & \{ & \mvec{1,1} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{1,2} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{1,3} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{2,1} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{2,2} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{2,3} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{3,1} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{3,2} \\
    &   &  , & \mvec{3,3} \\
    &   & \} &            \\
\end{alignmath}

The Cartesian product of a set $A$ with itself is usually denoted $A^2$ instead
of $A \times A$. Like I said, we like to be lazy.

\s{Function plots}

Okay, so, here's something that doesn't really fit in anywhere else. Now that
you know what Cartesian products are, as well as vectors, I can introduce you to
the \term{Cartesian coordinate plane}. Basically, it's a graphical
representation of $\R \times \R$:

\answergraph{VectorGraph1.png}

I also put some vectors on there. That looks really crappy, let me draw that
with a computer real quick:

\answergraph{VectorGraph2.png}

The source code for that graph is in \cref{src:vg2}.

As far as conventions go, you always list the horizontal coordinate first, and
the vertical coordinate second. Usually, the horizontal axis is labeled the
$x$-axis, and the vertical axis is labeled the $y$-axis. Hence, the convention
is to denote vectors on the plane as $\mvec{x,y}$

Okay, so given $A \times B$, a point $\mvec{x,y}$ on the Cartesian coordinate
plane represents the vector $\mvec{x,y}$, where $x \in A$, $y \in B$. With $\R$,
a point $\mvec{x, y}$ on the plane is the vector $\mvec{x,y} \in \R^2$

So, how do we plot a function? Well, basically, given a function $f : A \to B$,
you plot $\mvec{x, \eva{f}{x}} \in A \times B$.

You plot the domain on the $x$-axis, and the codomain on the $y$-axis. You put
the input value as the horizontal coordinate, and the output value as the
$y$-coordinate.

For instance:

\begin{displaymath}
  \parens{\ld{x} x^2} : \R \to \R
\end{displaymath}

\answergraph{x-squared-curve.png}

The source is in \cref{src:x-squared}.

Go to some point on the $x$-axis. Then go upwards from there until you hit the
line. Let's start with $8$. Find $8$ on the $x$-axis, then go up from there
until you get to the line. If you look, the vertical coordinate of the line at
that point is $64$, which is the square of $8$. That's kind of cool.

\s{The work of Georg Cantor}

Without further ado, we're going to look at Georg Cantor's work. Georg Cantor,
if you remember from \cref{ch:sets}, is the guy who first studied sets. He came
up with some bizzarre results.

First of all, long before Cantor, another guy, of whom you've likely heard,
Galileo Galilei, came up with a paradox. Galileo Galilei is usually mononymously
referred to as Galileo, mostly because it's easier to type. Galileo is most
famous for championing the idea that the earth revolves around the sun, and not
the other way around. He spent his last days under house arrest because he
believed that. Seventeenth century Italy didn't really have the same free speech
protections found today in the first world.

Anyway, I digress. Aside from his amazing work in physics, Galileo was among the
first to point out an interesting fact about $\N$: there are as many perfect
squares as there are natural numbers.\cite{expeditions} That's weird, because
the perfect squares are a subset of the natural numbers.

\begin{alignmath}{ccccccc}
  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & \dots & n & \dots \\
  \updownarrow & \updownarrow & \updownarrow & \updownarrow & \updownarrow & \updownarrow & \updownarrow \\
  1 & 4 & 9 & 16 & \dots & n^2 & \dots \\
\end{alignmath}

To be fair, Galileo wasn't the first person to come up with this paradox, he was
just among the first. He was the most famous person to come up with this
paradox, hence why it's named after him.\cite{w-galileo-paradox}

So, back to the real world: despite being a subset, the infinite set of perfect
squares has as many elements as the infinite superset of natural
numbers. Galileo decided that the only solution was to not consider words like
``larger'' or ``smaller'' when discussing infinite sets. Eventually,
mathematicians started talking about ``larger'' and ``smaller'' in the context
of infinite sets, just not the way Galileo would have.

If you want to look at this another way, we've found a bijection

\begin{alignedmath}
  f : \N \to \mset{x \in \N\semic y \in \N \comma x = y^2} \\
  \eva{f}{x} \ce x^2 \\
\end{alignedmath}

Galileo, and later Cantor, decided that two sets have the same number of
elements if there exists a bijection between them. Instead of saying ``have the
same number of elements'', we instead say ``have the same cardinality''.

So, $\mset{1,2,3}$ has the same cardinality as $\mset{4,5,6}$, because there's a
bijective relation between them.

\begin{displaymath}
\parens{\ld{x} x + 3} : \mset{1,2,3} \to \mset{4,5,6}
\end{displaymath}

If two sets are finite, as is the case with the previous example, their
cardinality is just the number of elements. So, the cardinality of
$\mset{1,2,3}$ is just $3$. If two sets $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality,
then I'm going to write $A \ae B$, which you should read as ``$A$ is cardinally
equal to $B$''.

Do you remember that example function from \cref{s:piecewise}?

\begin{rclmath}
  q & : & \N \to \Z \\
  \eva{q}{x} & \ce &
    \left\{
      \begin{array}{rcc}
        \text{$x$ is even} & \to & \frac{x}{2} \\
        \text{$x$ is odd} & \to & \ngp{\frac{x+1}{2}} \\
      \end{array}
    \right.
\end{rclmath}

\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{tabu}{|c|c|c|} \hline
    x & \eva{q}{x} & \text{$\eva{q}{x}$ reduced}  \\ \hline
    0 & \fracil{0}{2}     & 0 \\
    1 & \ngfracilpf{1+1}{2} & \ng 1 \\
    2 & \fracil{2}{2}     & 1 \\
    3 & \ngfracilpf{3+1}{2} & \ng 2 \\
    4 & \fracil{4}{2}     & 2 \\
    5 & \ngfracilpf{5+1}{2} & \ng 3 \\
    6 & \fracil{6}{2}     & 3 \\
    7 & \ngfracilpf{7+1}{2} & \ng 4 \\
    8 & \fracil{8}{2}     & 4 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabu}
\end{displaymath}

Wait wait wait!!!!! That's a bijection! Holy crap! So $\N \ae \Z$! That's
interesting! Again, despite $\N \subof \Z$, $\N \ae \Z$. That's kind of cool.

Let's plot that function:

\answergraph{nz-bijection.png}

Well that's a bit hard to follow. Let's draw a dotted line between each
successive point:

\answergraph{nz-bijection-joined.png}

Okay. Please note that since $q : \N \to \Z$, there aren't intermediate
values. The function only exists at the blue points. That is, you can't evaluate
$\eva{q}{2.5}$, because $2.5 \notin N$.

Anyway, the point is, we are able to enumerate through the values of $\Z$, the
same way we can with $\N$. We've found a bijection $q : \N \to \Z$, therefore
$\N = \Z$.

The cardinality of $\N$ (and also $\Z$) is called $\alnull$, pronounced
``aleph-null''. $\aleph$ is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, called
``aleph''.\footnote{Some early math textbooks accidentally printed the
  \reflectbox{\rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{$\aleph$}}
  upside-down.\cite{w-aleph-null} What a bunch of idiots.}

\ss{The cardinality of irrational numbers}

What about $\I$? $\I$ is seemingly more infinite than $\N$. $\N$ and $\Z$ are
discrete sets: it's pretty easy to enumerate through them. $\I$ is continuous
though. Between any two values, there's always an infinity of more values.

Let's, for fun, try to list every single irrational number. If we can list every
irrational number, then we must be able to enumerate through them, which would
mean that $\N \ae \I$

\begin{plainfile}

I have to do it \code{in monospace} so that everything is aligned, sorry. Okay,
let's take the first number, \code{1.714761022369152...}, and subtract $1$ from
its first digit: \code{0.714761022369152...}. Okay, easy enough

Let's do the same thing to the second number, with the second digit:

\code{4.008668726427755...} oops! It's a $0$. Well, let's just make it cyclic -
i.e. $0 - 1 \cong 9$.

So, we have
\code{4.008668726427755... -->  4.908668726427755...}

Let's list what we have so far

\begin{plainfile}
1.714761022369152... -> 0.714761022369152...
4.008668726427755... -> 4.908668726427755...

\end{plainfile}

So, for the $n$th number on the list, we change the $n$th digit. We're also
going to take the output of the flipping process, and list it in a new number at
bottom. Let's do this to a few more numbers, so you get the hang of it. I'm also
going to add a space around the number I changed, to make it more obvious

\begin{plainfile}

Wait wait wait! We've made a new irrational number that's different from all of the
other numbers in at least 1 digit, right?  It's different from the first number
in its first digit, it's different from the second number in its second digit,
and so on.

So, if we theoretically list all of the irrational numbers, in some sort of
order, we can still make another irrational number that's different than each of
them by at least one digit. Thus, it's impossible to list every single
irrational number, because there's always another one!

You can make the same argument for $\N$, sort of. There's always another natural
number, but it goes after all of the previous ones. With the irrational numbers,
we can always make a new irrational number that goes somewhere in the middle of
the set.

It's like if there was a long line to get tickets for a football game. Every
second, there's a new person coming. With $\N$ and $\Z$, you can just stick the
new person at the end of the line. With $\I$, however, you can't just stick the
new person at the end, you have to put him at a definite spot in the middle.

When the ticket booth person needs to help the next person, it's impossible to
determine who to help next, because every second there's a new person getting
stuck in front of the person first in line. You can't take down the names of the
first 20 people in line, because there's no concept of counting with the
irrational numbers. That concept exists with the natural numbers. $\aleph_0$ is
defined by being ``countably infinite'' - $\I$ is not countably infinite; it's
its own type of infinite.

So $\I \agt \N$!

Because $\R \supof \I$, it's not possible that $\R$ is countably
infinite. There's a part of $\R$ that you can't count, so you can't count all of
$\R$. Pretty simple:

\ss{Rational numbers}

Here's where it gets interesting. If you remember, $\Q$, the rational numbers,
is all numbers that can be written as a ratio of $\frac{x}{y}$, where
$x,y \in \Z, y \ne 0$. Incidentially, they are also numbers that follow some
sort of pattern.

Well, that definition looks sort of familiar: What if we wrote $\Q$ this way:

\begin{displaymath}
  \Q = \Z \times \parens{\Z \bs \mset{0}}
\end{displaymath}

Where $\mvec{x,y} \in \Z \times \parens{\Z \bs \mset{0}}$ maps to the fraction
$\frac{x}{y}$.

We've done Cartesian coordinate planes of $\R^2$ and $\N \times \Z$. Is there
any reason we can't do one of $\Z \times \parens{\Z \bs \mset{0}}$?

Well, of course not!

\answergraph{nq-bijection-nolines.png}

Every blue dot at some point $\mvec{x,y}$ represents the fraction
$\frac{x}{y}$. So, the dot at $\mvec{1,3}$ represents the fraction
$\frac{1}{3}$. Note that there are no points on the line $y = 0$, because you
can't divide by zero.

So, can we enumerate through those? That is, follow some pattern that will
eventually encapsulate every rational number? There's no harm in trying!

The na\"ive way to do it would be to just head in one direction until you stop.

\answergraph{nq-bijection-naive.png}

Of course, you never stop, so this won't work.

With the $\N \to \Z$ bijection, we sort of doubled back on ourselves:

\answergraph{nz-bijection-joined.png}

Maybe let's try that with this:

\answergraph{nq-bijection.png}

Hey! That works. If we keep going, we'll enumerate through $\Q$! So $\Q \ae \N$!

\s{Okay, that's great. What the hell is that function?}

Well, to be honest, I'm not sure. I wrote the script to generate the graph by
doing some very shoddy programming, but I don't know the associated
function. How about, as an, um, exercise, I explain my logic?

Let's look at that graph again:

\answergraph{nq-bijection.png}

Let's call the hypothetical function that defines that bijection $r$

\begin{displaymath}
  r : \N \to \Q
\end{displaymath}

First of all, we start at the coordinate $\mvec{0,1}$. So we can write

\begin{displaymath}
  \eva{r}{0} \ce \mvec{0,1}
\end{displaymath}

\s{Conclusion}

These are the bizarre results Cantor found, which his colleagues refused to
believe.

The method I used to prove that $\I$ was uncountable is called ``Cantor's
diagonal argument''. He had proven years beforehand that $\I \agt \N$, using a
completely different method. The diagonal method is much more approachable, so I
used that instead.

More importantly, you can use the diagonal argument in a variety of different
ways. The most interesting such way is Russell's paradox, which I'll get to in
the next chapter.

The conclusion to draw from this section is:
