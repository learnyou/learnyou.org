Before we get into interesting content, you have to understand some
stuff. This stuff is pretty easy. This will likely be one of the shorter
and easier chapters in the book.

Most people think math is about dealing with numbers and pumping out
formulas. Well, that's not what math is about. As said in \cref{intro},
it's about using math as a language to express your thoughts. Most
people don't think about numbers all day; thus, we deal with things in
math that aren't numbers.

In this next section, we're going to outline some basic rules for
reasoning about things. You need to know these rules to do really cool
stuff. Although, as you will (hopefully) see, these rules can be fun to
toy around with on their own.

It's okay if you don't remember all of these rules. You can always find
a list in \cref{d-booleans}.
