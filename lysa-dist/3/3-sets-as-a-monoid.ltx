\s{Combining sets together}

Next, we're going to talk about ways to combine two sets together. There are any
number of ways to do this. However, the two most common ways are through
\term{unions} and \term{intersections}.

The union symbol is pretty easy to memorize --- it looks like a giant U:
$\cup$. Think ``$\cup$nion''.\footnote{You don't have to remember it this way,
  because $\cup$ is already aligned reasonably well with the letters. Thus I
  didn't have to spend 30 minutes getting the alignment correct. (See
  \cref{30minalign}.)}.

If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A \cup B$ is the set of elements that are in
either $A$ or in $B$. That is:

\[ A \cup B = \mset{x \in \amb \semic \parens{x \in A} \lor \parens{x \in B}} \]

You might also remember this by the fact that the union symbol $\cup$ looks
vaguely like the or symbol $\lor$.

\pg{What the hell is that notation?}

\label{comprehensions}
That's called a \term{class comprehension}. It's a hacky way to describe a
set. Technically, it describes a \term{class}, which is different than a set.
That said, at least until chapter 5, they only describe sets!

Remember earlier when I would show you the mechanics for defining arbitrary
subsets of a set? Well, this is a common way to do it.

You should look at the expression in two pieces: before the semicolon and after
the semicolon. The term before the semicolon explains what each element looks
like, and defines it to be a member of an ambient set. In this case --- and in
most cases --- the element will just be $x$, or $a$, or something of the like.

\[ A \cup B = \mset{x \in \amb \semic \parens{x \in A} \lor \parens{x \in B}} \]

Okay, cool. The right side of the semicolon lists conditions that must be true
about the thing on the left. In this case, $x$ must be in $A$, logical-or it
must be in $B$.

The $\amb$ is shorthand for ``ambient set''. It's a set such that
$A, B \subeq \amb$. For reasons I can't quite explain yet, you need to specify
that the element variable ($x$ in this case) is an element of another set. The
consequence of this is, a set comprehension can only be used to make a
\xti{subset} of another set. $\amb$ is the shorthand for ``there's another set
out there, but I don't care what it is (and you shouldn't either)''.

Can you think of another consequence?

Well, since we are defining the union using a notation which can only be used to
describe subsets, we can only take the union of two sets if they are both
subsets of some larger set! That's annoying. Oh well.

\ss{Back to business}

Let's look at that definition of the union again:

\[ A \cup B = \mset{x \in \amb \semic \parens{x \in A} \lor \parens{x \in B}} \]

You know already that $\lor$ is commutative (the order doesn't matter), so you
can write this

\[ A \cup B = \mset{x \in \amb \semic \parens{x \in B}} \lor \parens{x \in A} \]

You've probably figured out, any property of $\lor$ is also true of $\cup$

\begin{description}
\item[Reflexive property] $a \union a \equiv a$
\item[Associative property] $a \union \parens{b \union c} \equiv \parens{a \union b} \union c$
\item[Commutative property] $a \union b \equiv b \union a$
\end{description}

\ss{The intersection}

The intersection is, you guessed it - what happens when we use $\land$ in the
above definition instead of $\lor$. Can you guess what the symbol for
``intersection'' is? If you guessed $\cap$, then you are right!

\[ A \cap B = \mset{x \in \amb \semic \parens{x \in A} \land \parens{x \in B}} \]

Since $\land$ is also reflexive, associative, and commutative, the same
properties exist for $\cap$.

\begin{description}
\item[Reflexive property] $a \intersect a \equiv a$
\item[Associative property] $a \intersect \parens{b \intersect c} \equiv \parens{a \intersect b} \intersect c$
\item[Commutative property] $a \intersect b \equiv b \intersect a$
\end{description}

You can actually reduce the definition of $\cap$ to 

\[ A \cap B = \mset{x \in A \st \parens{x \in B}} \]

(I do this in the proofs a lot)

The standard example of unions and intersections is to use ``Venn diagrams''. I
drew some myself in \cref{fig:venns}.\footnote{It's a tradition from Learn You a
  Haskell that each book include poorly-drawn explanatory graphics by the
  author.}

    Q. My handwriting sucks, deal with it.}

\end{figure}

\ss{More on the comprehension}

I use the comprehension quite a lot (other books do as well), so I should at
least take a subsubsection to explain it.

I'm going to list some \xti{axioms} about comprehensions, which you would do
well to remember:

Let $p$ be a \text{unary predicate}. Basically, it takes the $x$, and determines
whether or not that $x$ is to be included in the comprehended set.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  $\mset{x \in A \semic x \in \mset{y \in B; \evalat{p}{y}}} \equiv \mset{x \in
    A \semic x \in B \land \evalat{p}{x}}$
\item
  $\mset{x \in A \semic x \notin \mset{y \in B; \evalat{p}{y}}} \equiv \mset{x \in
    A \semic x \notin B \lor \lnot\evalat{p}{x}}$
\end{enumerate}

\ss{Back to unions and intersects}

The final piece of the puzzle is this:

\begin{description}
\item \mtb{A \cap \parens{B \cup C} \equiv \parens{A \cap B} \cup \parens{A \cap C}} 

  \begin{proof}
    \begin{rclmath}
      A \cap \parens{B \cup C}
      & \ce & \mset{
        x \in A \st
        x \in B \lor
        x \in C
      } \\
      \parens{A \cap B} \cup \parens{A \cap C}
      & \ce & \mset{
        x \in \amb \st
        \parens{
          x \in A \land
          x \in B
        }\lor
        \parens{
          x \in A \land
          x \in C
        }
      } \\
      & \ce & \mset{
        x \in \amb \st
        x \in A \land
        \parens{
          x \in B \lor
          x \in C
        }
      } \\
      & \ce & \mset{
        x \in A \st
        x \in B \lor
        x \in C
      } \\
    \end{rclmath}
  \end{proof}
\end{description}

You're probably wondering what that white box is. It's mathematical shorthand
for ``I'm done proving stuff''.

I can't faithfully discuss sets any more without talking about functions. So,
you get a lucky break! No exercises (because the fun exercises require that you
know about functions.)

I would tell you to look in \cref{d-sets} if you don't remember stuff. However,
\cref{d-sets} assumes you have read both \cref{ch:functions} and
\cref{ch:more-sets}. So, in conclusion, don't look at \cref{d-sets} quite yet.
