\s{Booleans as a monoid}

Okay, first of all, what the hell does the section title mean?

Let's go over it:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \term{Booleans} the values true and false. ``Boolean algebra''
    is what we are doing in this section. Dealing with Booleans.

    \xti{Why are you capitalizing the word Boolean?}

    Because the term is named after a guy named George Boole, who
    studied them to extent.

  \item A \term{monoid} is a set of things, where you can combine the
    individual things together. Additionally, there has to be a
    \term{monoidal identity}.

    \xti{That doesn't help me.}

    Well, let me explain it at the end of the chapter.
\end{enumerate}

So, sometimes we need to combine two pieces of logic together. There are
two ways we can do this - logical-or and logical-and.

I put logical- in front of them, because the mathematical meaning is
slightly different than the colloquial meaning.

Mathematicians are lazy, so we don't like to write ``logical-and''
whenever we want to say it, so instead we use the symbol $\land$.

$A \land B$ is true if (and only if) both $A$ and $B$ are true. If one
of them is false, then the entire thing is false.

On the other side, we have logical-or. The symbol for logical-or is
$\lor$.  $A \lor B$ is true if either $A$ or $B$ is true, or if both of
them are true. You could think of logical-or as being equivalent to the
colloquial ``and/or''.

If you're having trouble remembering which symbol is logical-and and
which one is logical-or, remember that the logical-and symbol ---
$\land$ --- looks vaguely like an A.

\sss{More formally}

There are formal ways to define $\lnot$, $\land$ and $\lor$

I'm going to introduce a symbol: $\ce$. It means ``is defined to be
equal to''.

\[ x \ce y\]

means ``$x$ is defined to be equal to $y$''.

With that in mind, here is a more formal definition of $\land$:

\begin{alignmath}{rclcl}
    \false & \land & \_      & \ce & \false \\
    \true  & \land & x       & \ce & x \\
\end{alignmath}

The $\_$ just means ``you can ignore whatever goes here''.

Likewise, for $\lor$:

\begin{alignmath}{rclcl}
    \true   & \lor & \_       & \ce & \true \\
    \false  & \lor & x        & \ce & x \\
\end{alignmath}

and finally for $\lnot$:

\begin{alignmath}{rlcl}
    \lnot & \parens{\lnot x} & \ce & x \\
    \lnot & \true            & \ce & \false \\
\end{alignmath}


\ss{Properties of the Boolean operators}

There are a lot of properties about $\lnot$, $\land$, and $\lor$. Most
of them are pretty intuitive, so you won't have trouble memorizing
them. You should try to remember the names of the properties, but it's
not really that important.

\begin{description}
  \item[Cancellative property] For all Boolean values \(a\),

    \begin{displaymath}
        \lnot \lnot a = a
    \end{displaymath}

    I mentioned this before somewhere in \cref{props}. This is so simple
    that it's impossible to prove. Thus, it's called an \term{axiom} or
    \term{postulate}.

  \item[Reflexive property] For all Boolean values \(a\),

    \begin{displaymath}
        a \land a = a
    \end{displaymath}

    Likewise, for all $a$,

    \begin{displaymath}
        a \lor a = a
    \end{displaymath}

    This is called the \term{reflexive property}.

    \begin{proof}
        
    \end{proof}

  \item[Associative property]
    For all $a$, $b$, and $c$,

    $$a \land \parens{b \land c} \equiv \parens{a \land b} \land c$$

  \item [Commutative property]
    For all $a$ and $b$:

    $$a \land b \equiv b \land a$$
  \item [Distributive property]
    $a \land \parens{b \lor c} \equiv \parens{a \land b} \lor \parens{a
      \land c}$
  \item [De Morgan's first law]
    $\lnot\parens{a \land b} \equiv \lnot a \lor \lnot b$
  \item [Reflexive property] $a \lor a \equiv a$
  \item [Associative property]
    $a \lor \parens{b \lor c} \equiv \parens{a \lor b} \lor c$
  \item [Commutative property] $a \lor b \equiv b \lor a$
\end{description}

These values, true and false, are called \term{Booleans}. They are named after a
mathematician named George Boole who studied them to
extent.\cite{w-boolean-algebra}

\ss{If (and only if)}

I'm going to introduce some new notation: the $\iff$ symbol.

\[ \parens{A \iff B} \iff \parens{A \implies B} \land \parens{A
  \impliedby B} \]

Okay, what the hell is that?

\begin{textmath}
    If

    \[ A \implies B \]

    logical-and

    \[ B \implies A \]

    then

    \[ A \iff B \]

    Likewise, if

    \[ A \iff B \]

    then

    \[ A \implies B \]

    logical-and

    \[ B \implies A \]
\end{textmath}

The symbol \nm\iff\ should be read as ``if (and only if)''. Sometimes
I'll write the word iff --- with two `f's --- that's the same as ``if
(and only if)''.

In order to do the exercises (yes, there are exercises), you need to
know these properties of \nm\implies .

\begin{enumerate}
  \item For all $a$

    \begin{displaymath}
        a \implies a
    \end{displaymath}

    So, if $a$ is true, that means that $a$ is true. Duh.

  \item For all \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\),

    If 

    \begin{displaymath}
        a \implies b
    \end{displaymath}

    and

    \begin{displaymath}
        b \implies c
    \end{displaymath}

    then

    \begin{displaymath}
        a \implies c
    \end{displaymath}
    
    For this reason, we can write $a \implies b \implies c$ without any
    ambiguity.

\end{enumerate}

Sometimes, mathematicians, such as myself, will use the symbol $\forall$
in the place of ``for all''.

\begin{ExcList}
  \Exercise[label={demorgan2}]{
    $\lnot\parens{A \lor B} \Qequiv \lnot A \land \lnot B$

    I'll spoil it for you. This is called \term{De Morgan's second law}, and
    it's true. You can prove it using the cancellative property and the first
    law.  }
  \Answer{
      Start with the first law

      \[ \lnot\parens{a \land b} \equiv \lnot a \lor \lnot b \]

      Let $p = \lnot a$, $q = \lnot b$. One of the rules of algebra is, if
      $x = y$, then you can substitute one in for the other.

      \[ p \lor q \equiv \lnot\parens{\lnot p \land \lnot q} \]

      Another rule is, if you have an equation, and you do something to one side
      of the =, you have to do the same thing to the other side. Here, we're
      going to apply $\lnot$ to both sides of $\equiv$

      \[ \lnot\parens{p \lor q} \equiv {\lnot p \land \lnot q} \]
  }

  \Exercise{
    Here's another one for you.

    \begin{displaymath}
       a \lor \parens{b \land c} \Qequiv \parens{a \lor b} \land \parens{b \lor c}
    \end{displaymath}

    You need the distributive property, as well as the proof from
    \cref{demorgan2}.

    While we are at it, these proofs can be found in \cref{d-booleans}, as well
    as the solutions to these problems.  }

  \Answer{
    Start with the first property

    \begin{displaymath}
      a \land \parens{b \lor c} \equiv \parens{a \land b} \lor \parens{b \land c}
    \end{displaymath}

    Apply $\lnot$ to both sides

    \begin{displaymath}
      \lnot\parens{a \land \parens{b \lor c}} \equiv \lnot\parens{\parens{a \land b} \lor \parens{b \land c}}
    \end{displaymath}

    Apply DeMorgan's laws

    \begin{displaymath}
      \lnot a \lor \lnot\parens{b \lor c} \equiv \lnot\parens{a \land b} \land \lnot\parens{b \land c}
    \end{displaymath}

    Do it again (inside the parentheses).

    \begin{displaymath}
      \lnot a \lor \parens{\lnot b \land \lnot c} \equiv \parens{\lnot a \lor \lnot b} \land \parens{\lnot b \lor \lnot c}
    \end{displaymath}

    Let $p,q,r = \lnot a, \lnot b, \lnot c$, respectively.

    \begin{displaymath}
      p \lor \parens{q \land r} \equiv \parens{p \lor q} \land \parens{q \lor r}
    \end{displaymath}
  }

  \Exercise{$\lnot A \implies B \implies \lnot C$

    \begin{displaymath}
      C \Qimplies A
    \end{displaymath}
  }

  \Answer{Yes.

    \begin{proof}
        By transition,

      \begin{alignmath}{ccccc}
        \lnot A & \implies & B & \implies & \lnot C \\
        \lnot A &          &   & \implies & \lnot C \\
      \end{alignmath}

      By the reversal property:
      \begin{displaymath}
        A \impliedby C
      \end{displaymath}
    \end{proof}
  }

  \Exercise{$A \notimplies B \implies \lnot C$

    \begin{displaymath}
      A \Qimplies C
    \end{displaymath}
  }

  \Answer{Not by necessity.
    \begin{proof}
      By transition:
      \begin{alignmath}{ccccc}
        A & \notimplies & B & \implies & \lnot C \\
        A & \notimplies &   &          & \lnot C \\
      \end{alignmath}

      This does not imply

      \begin{displaymath}
        A \implies C
      \end{displaymath}
      
      To put it another way
      \begin{rclmath}
        A & \notimplies & \lnot C \\
          & \centernot\Downarrow &  \\
        A & \implies & C
      \end{rclmath}
    \end{proof}
  }

  \Exercise{$A \implies B \impliedby C$

    \begin{displaymath}
      A \Qiff C
    \end{displaymath}
  }

  \Answer{No, there's nothing to indicate that $A$ and $C$ have any relation
    whatsoever.}

  \Exercise{$A \land \lnot\parens{B \land \parens{C \lor D}} \Qequiv A
    \land \parens{B \lor C} \land \parens{B \lor D}$ }

  \Answer{No
    \begin{proof}
      Let's assume that it's true.
      \begin{rclmath}
        A \land \lnot\brackets{B \land \parens{C \lor D}}
          & \equiv & A \land \parens{B \lor C} \land \parens{B \lor D} \\
      \end{rclmath}
      Let $B, C, D$ all be true. Then:

      \begin{rclmath}
        A \land \lnot\brackets{\true \land \parens{\true \lor \true}}
          & \equiv & A \land \parens{\true \lor \true} \land \parens{\true \lor \true} \\
        A \land \lnot\brackets{\true \land \parens{\true \lor \true}}
          & \equiv & A \land \true \land \true \\
        A \land \lnot\brackets{\true \land \parens{\true \lor \true}}
          & \equiv & A \land \true \\
        A \land \lnot\brackets{\true \land \true}
          & \equiv & A \land \true \\
        A \land \lnot\true
          & \equiv & A \land \true \\
        A \land \lnot\true
          & \equiv & A \land \true \\
        \false
          & \equiv & \true \\
      \end{rclmath}

      Which is obviously false.
    \end{proof}
  }
\end{ExcList}

\ss{Wait, are you going to tell me what a monoid is?}

Okay, you got me!

$\mset{\true,\false}$, along with the operator $\land$ is a
monoid. Additionally, $\mset{\true,\false}$, along with the operator
$\lor$ forms a monoid.

The ``monoidal identity'' just means that if you take any $a$, and
$\land$ it with $\true$, you're going to get $a$ back again.

The same thing happens with $\lor$ and $\false$

\begin{textmath}
    For all Boolean values $a$,

    \[ a \land \true = a \]


    Likewise, for all Boolean values $a$,

    \[ a \lor \false = a \]
\end{textmath}
